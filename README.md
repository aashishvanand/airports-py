    'continent': 'AS',
    'type': 'large_airport',
    'has_scheduled_service': True
})
```

### Using Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can also directly execute Python code from the CLI without entering the interactive shell. Navigate to the root of your project and run:

```bash
python3 -c "from airports import airport_data; result = airport_data.get_airport_by_iata('MAA'); print(result)"
```

Replace `'MAA'` with other codes as needed.

## Testing

To test the library locally:

1. Navigate to the root of the project:

```bash
cd path_to_airports-py
```

2. Run the tests using:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests -v
```

This command will discover and run all test files inside the `tests` directory and provide a detailed output.

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashishvanand/airports-py.git
```

2. **Change into the cloned directory:**
```bash
cd airports-py
```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. **Install development dependencies:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install build twine pytest pytest-cov
```

6. **Install the package in development mode:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

7. **Generate the compressed data file (if needed):**
```bash
# Generate airports.gz from airports.json
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py

# Verify the data file
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --verify-only
```

### Testing

8. **Run all tests:**
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

9. **Run tests with pytest (alternative):**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

10. **Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=airports --cov-report=term-missing
```

11. **Test basic functionality manually:**
```bash
python -c "
from airports import airport_data
print('Testing IATA lookup:')
result = airport_data.get_airport_by_iata('LHR')
print(f'Found: {result[0][\"airport\"]}')
print('✅ Basic functionality working!')
"
```

### Building and Validation

12. **Build the package:**
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/

# Build package
python -m build
```

13. **Validate the package:**
```bash
twine check dist/*
```

14. **Test package installation:**
```bash
pip install dist/airports_py-*.whl --force-reinstall
```

### Development Scripts

The project includes utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

#### Generate Compressed Data File
```bash
# Generate airports.gz from airports.json
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py

# Generate with custom compression level
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --compression 6

# Generate with custom source/output files
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --source custom_data.json --output custom_data.gz

# Verify existing compressed file
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --verify-only
```

### Quick Development Workflow

For ongoing development, use this workflow:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes to the code

# 2. Regenerate data file if JSON was updated
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py

# 3. Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Build and validate
python -m build && twine check dist/*

# 5. Test installation
pip install dist/airports_py-*.whl --force-reinstall
```

### Troubleshooting

**If you get import errors:**
- Ensure you're in the virtual environment: `which python` should show the venv path
- Verify the package is installed: `pip list | grep airports`
- Check import works: `python -c "import airports.airport_data"`

**If data file is missing:**
- Generate it: `python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py`
- Verify location: `ls -la airports/data/airports.gz`
- Check file integrity: `python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --verify-only`

**If tests fail:**
- Ensure data file exists and is valid
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`
- Run individual tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_airport_data.py::TestAirportData::test_get_airport_by_iata -v`

**If build fails:**
- Ensure `setup.py` has correct package data configuration
- Check that `airports/data/airports.gz` exists and is included in package

### Deactivating Environment

When you're done developing:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Data Management

The airport data is stored in `airports/data/` directory:
- `airports.json` - Source data in JSON format (4.7MB)
- `airports.gz` - Compressed data used by the library (617KB, 86.9% compression)

### Updating Airport Data

1. **Update the source JSON file:**
```bash
# Edit airports/data/airports.json with new airport data
```

2. **Regenerate the compressed file:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py
```

3. **Verify the update:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_airports_gz.py --verify-only
python -c "from airports import airport_data; print(f'Loaded {len(airport_data.airports)} airports')"
```

4. **Run tests to ensure compatibility:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
